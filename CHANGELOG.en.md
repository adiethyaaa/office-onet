# Changelog

All notable changes to kantor-rpg, newest first. Each release goes to the [public demo](https://employee-rpg.air-buddy.site) after the tests and CI pass. The release code is the commit on `main`.

## v2.1.1, 14 October 2026 (release `84a8678`)

**Gym animations**

- Characters on a treadmill now run on the belt, facing its console. Before, they stood on the floor between the two treadmills.
- Characters on the exercise bike now sit on the saddle, pedal, and hold the handlebar. Before, they just stood next to the bike.
- The exercise bike model was rebuilt in Blender to fit the characters: a 0.45 m saddle (the seat height of the character animations), pedals right under the feet, and the handlebar at hand height. The old model was too tall, so the feet could not reach the pedals.

## v2.1, 13 October 2026 (release `5049ff0`)

**Chess moved to the table**

- **Office Chess** is played at the board game table in the Game room, floor 2, instead of slot 6 of the Game Station. An 8x8 chessboard sits on the table.
- Chess opens from the table or any of its four stools. The avatar takes the nearest free stool, and while you play, NPCs see that stool as taken.
- Full chess rules (castling, en passant, promotion, checkmate, draws) against a teammate at three difficulty levels.
- Game Station slot 6 is empty again. There are now 15 mini games: 10 at office facilities and 5 in the Game Station.

**More responsive mini game buttons**

- On 120 Hz screens (iPhone Pro, iPad Pro, Mac ProMotion) quick presses used to get lost. In a 30-press test v2.0 received 0; v2.1 receives 30, on 144 Hz screens too.
- Every press is now queued and handed to the game one at a time, so two quick presses still count as two.
- One press opens one layer. A gamepad A or an Enter that is still held no longer picks a Game Station slot or presses **Start** right away.
- Esc on the "Loading game..." screen closes the game.
- The Game Station follows the **Reversed buttons** controller profile.
- After a mini game closes, focus returns to the button that opened it, so keyboard and screen reader users keep their place.

**Mini game polish**

- Every game has a tutorial for the device in use (keyboard, gamepad, touch screen) with the right button names.
- Touch buttons on phones catch very short taps.
- Billiard physics rebuilt: balls slide, then roll, and backspin or topspin makes the cue ball stop, draw back, or follow through.
- The 3D reprimand is polished: a wind-up swing, a motion trail, a hit pause, cartoon words ("PLAK!", "TUK!", "POK!"), and a bouncing paper ball.
- New background music in a cozy game style: 12 original songs, 6 for office areas and 6 for mini games.

**HUD and phone layout**

- At 600 to 959 px wide (phones in landscape, small tablets) the top menu shows icons only. Before, Settings and Controls were cut off at the edge.
- The Controls dialog opens at the top instead of scrolled to the bottom.
- Notifications no longer cover the Action button, the Game Station, or mini game cards.
- The people list on the Map no longer changes while you touch it, so **Temui** (Meet) does not miss.

## v2.0, 13 October 2026 (release `18c7044`)

Requirements document: [PRD v2.0](PRD/PRD-v2.0.md).

- **14 mini games.** Nine office facilities open their own game: treadmill, dumbbell rack, mat, billiard table, coffee machine, server rack, drafting table, easel, and the library bookshelf.
- **Game Station.** The arcade cabinets and TV in the Game room open a 10-slot menu with 5 games: Drone Race, Office Brawl, Floor Hopper, Cable Link, and Bomb Arena.
- A game downloads only when opened, so the office stays light. Top 10 scores are kept in the browser.
- **Sound without audio files.** Footsteps, doors, the lift, and music per area are generated in the browser. Nearby effects get louder as you approach. Adjust in Settings > Sound, mute with **V**.
- **New animations.** 11 new clips: start walking, stop, turn, lift weights, cycle, draw, lay cable, fast typing, surprised, rub head, and flee. Walking and running blend smoothly with speed, the body leans into runs and turns, and characters glance at the CEO walking past.
- **Reprimand.** An NPC's profile card offers three ways to reprimand: a rolled paper swat, a toy hammer tap, or a thrown paper ball. Animation only; nothing is sent to the agent. NPCs whose agent is working cannot be reprimanded.

## v1.1, 11 to 13 October 2026

- **Map and minimap** (`ff2cd1e`): where every character is on each floor, other-floor badges, and **Temui** (Meet) across floors.
- **English** (`725a516`): two-language interface with a choice in Settings.
- **Phone HUD** (`e7d001a`): one row of menu icons; the menu and minimap fold away, and the choice is remembered.
- **Gamepad** (`1f6becc`): walking, camera, A/B/X/Y, LB/RB, Select, Start, and D-pad navigation in every menu.
- **Controller profiles** (`bedba72`): Standard, Left-handed, Relaxed, and Reversed buttons in Japanese style, with a pad diagram that lights up the pressed button.
- **Walk through NPCs** (`a7cb594`): keep pushing for 2 seconds, or run, and the avatar passes through an NPC in the way.
- **Agent chat** (`dd5b12b`): the Voice button works; `/new`, `/stop`, `/status`, `/telegram`, `/help` run on the server.
- **Solid walls** (`ac604d0`): the see-through wall effect is gone.
- **ICT riser removed** (`627f00d`): the avatar could get stuck in the shaft, so the area joined the store and service rooms. Rooms went from 38 to 36.
- Small fixes: the board refresh no longer clears the login form (`18258d0`), and dialog Close buttons moved to the footer (`ff6ef86`).

## v1.0 and earlier, 3 to 10 October 2026

- **Telegram-like chat** (`e480894`): typing indicator, ticks, push notifications, PWA, photos, files, and voice messages turned into text.
- **Echo and Leo personas** (`671accd2`): two new characters, 8 NPCs in total.
- **No more flickering windows** (`cad7bc4`).
- **v0.2** (`fa666c9a`): the two-floor 3D world, seeded NPCs, Office Studio, Avatar Studio, directory, work board, owner login with 2FA, and 15 working drawing sheets from one dataset.
